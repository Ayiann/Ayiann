Hello everyone, I am a front-end developer passionate about crafting efficient and aesthetic web interfaces. In my spare time, I particularly enjoy watching anime with thrilling plots and heartwarming moments, which always inspire and relax me. I believe that both programming and anime have their unique place and value in life.
